The project is about a keychain containing a QR code. The code when scanned for the first time, takes you to a page to register the keychain with information about the owner of that object. From then on, every time it is scanned, it will take us to a page with that information.

## Docker

If you are a _Mac/Linux_ user, I recommend you https://orbstack.dev/ to manage your _Docker_ containers.

You have a containerized version of the app. To build the image, run:

```sh
docker build -t howiti .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 howiti
# docker-compose up --build is an alternative
```

## Testing

This project uses _PyTest_ for testing. To run tests, execute on root directory `PYTHONPATH=. pytest path_to_test_dir` where proceed in the terminal.

## Tips

-   You can see the docs through the Swagger(http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) or ReDoc(http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) endpoint.
